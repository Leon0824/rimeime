#summary Building and installing ibus-rime.
#labels Phase-Deploy

== Prerequisites ==

To build la rime, you need these libraries:
  * boost
  * gtest
  * ibus
  * kyotocabinet
  * opencc
  * yaml-cpp

== Build and install ibus-rime ==

Don't know if it will work for you...
{{{
mkdir rimeime
cd rimeime
svn checkout http://rimeime.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/brise
svn checkout http://rimeime.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/ibus-rime
svn checkout http://rimeime.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/librime
cd ibus-rime
chmod +x install.sh
# this script uses 'sudo' to install ibus-rime; do this as YOU
./install.sh
}}}

== Configure IBus ==

Add "Rime" to the input method list in IBus Preferences, and... Voil√† !

But it takes a while to prepare preset dictionaries at first start.
Rime is temporarily disabled during that period for maintenance.
