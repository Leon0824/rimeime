ibus-rime: Rime Input Method Engine for Linux/IBus

Manual Installation
===================

Prerequisites
-------------

To build la rime, you need these tools and libraries:

  * cmake >= 2.8
  * ibus >= 1.0
  * boost >= 1.46
  * gtest (optional)
  * kyotocabinet 1.2
  * opencc 0.3
  * yaml-cpp 0.3

Build and install ibus-rime
---------------------------

You need both librime and ibus-rime packages.

```
tar xzvf librime-*.tar.gz
cd librime
make
sudo make install

tar xzvf ibus-rime-*.tar.gz
cd ibus-rime
make
sudo make install
```

Configure IBus
--------------
  * restart IBus
  * add 'Rime' to the input method list in IBus Preferences

Configure Rime
--------------
http://code.google.com/p/rimeime/wiki/CustomizationGuide

You will work with config files a lot.
After making some changes, issue the commands in a terminal:
```
rm ~/.ibus/rime/default.yaml
ibus-daemon -drx
```

It may take some time to rebuild dictionaries, depending on what has been changed.
Rime will come back to work as soon as the deployment is finished.
If it doesn't, see ~/.ibus/rime/rime.log for error messages.

Thank you.
